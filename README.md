**🧠 Psychiatric Mental Health Chatbot**

A conversational AI chatbot designed to provide supportive conversations and coping strategies for users experiencing mild to moderate mental health concerns. Built for accessibility, the chatbot acts as an empathetic companion, offering mood-guided dialogue and mental wellness resources—not a replacement for professional therapy.


**✨ Key Features**

💬 Conversational interface leveraging NLP for mental health support

🧩 Mood recognition via sentiment analysis of user inputs

🤝 Empathetic and context-aware responses guiding users toward coping strategies

📚 Resource linking and escalation prompts for mental health professionals during crises

🔄 Lightweight rule‑based and/or retrieval‑based dialogue flow logic


**🧠 Motivation & Background**

By increasing access to preliminary mental health assistance, this chatbot contributes to scalable support for individuals who may feel reluctant to seek conventional therapy. AI chatbots like Woebot and others have demonstrated effectiveness in easing depressive and anxiety symptoms in short-term usage—especially when built using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) frameworks (poojachandrashekara.medium.com, github.com, en.wikipedia.org). However, AI is not a substitute for licensed care and should be viewed as complementary support (en.wikipedia.org).

**🏗️ Architecture & Workflow**

**System Flowchart**

User Input → Sentiment & Intent Classifier → Dialogue Engine
        ↓                     ↓
     Coping Suggestion       Resource/Escalation Trigger
        ↓
   Response Delivery → Chat Interface

   
**Core Components**

User Interface: Python-based CLI or web interface (e.g., Flask/Streamlit)

Backend Logic: NLP processing for intent/sentiment classification

Response Engine: Rule-based or retrieval-based response generation

Resource Handling: Predefined crisis hotlines and escalation messaging

Data Storage (Optional): Local files or lightweight database to log chats


**📦 Tech Stack & Dependencies**

Language: Python 3.x (3.6 ≤ preferred ≤ 3.8 for compatibility)

Libraries:

NLP: NLTK, spaCy, VADER, Scikit‑learn

Web: Flask or Streamlit (optional)

Data: JSON/CSV files for intents and responses

Chat Logging: Python logging or simple database


**🚨 Limitations & Ethical Considerations**

❗ Not a medical device or licensed therapist: Users are encouraged to seek professional help when needed.

🔍 Privacy & Data Security: Conversations may be logged; secure storage and data consent are essential.

⚠️ Bias & Accuracy: Limited training data or deterministic logic may lead to inappropriate or ineffective responses.

💥 Risk Management: No capacity for crisis diagnosis—validated crisis hotlines must be provided when needed (github.com, github.com, wired.com).


**✅ Expected Benefits**

Enhanced accessibility	Offers mental health support when access to therapists is limited
User engagement	Empowers users to reflect on emotional states and coping habits
Early intervention	Prompts users toward skilled care as needed
Educational tool	Demonstrates AI‑based chatbot design grounded in mental health best practices
